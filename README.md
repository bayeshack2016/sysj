## The future

- show NTL (night-time light) data and change over time (give us 1 more hour and we'll have these change in infrared light heatmaps done!)
- analyze whole world (using world bank PPP/CPI data), with focus on developing countries (NTL should be stronger signal there than in developed countries)
- show entire country view for state-to-state comparisons
- show entire state view for county-to-county comparisons
- automated pipeline that takes in raw VIIRS images, and generates both NTL statistics and powers the web app for data exploration
